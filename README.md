# Option Pricing
This project applies an object oriented approach to compute the prices of American and European Call and Put options using different pricing methods such as Monte Carlo, the analytical Black-Scholes formula and the Binomial tree method.

### *Option Pricing using Binomial Tree Model*
Generates a binomial option pricing tree based on the parameters one inputs in order to achieve the price of the option premium. Applicable to European as well as American options. 

### *Monte Carlo Simulation*
Contains the following:
  1. A serial approach to the estimation of Pi using the Monte Carlo Method (C++)
  2. A Multithreaded estimation of Pi based on the Monte Carlo Method (C++)
  3. Using matplotlib, plots the estimated value of Pi using Monte Carlo Method (Python)
  
(MORE METHODS TO BE ADDED SOON)
